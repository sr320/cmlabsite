Working on my SICB abstract to get over to Steven and Camille for a quick edit pass before I submit it through the portal tomorrow.\n\n\n\n\n\nSunday. Off in Big Sur\n\n\n\n\n\nSaturday. Off in Monterey and Big Sur. I visited the aquarium and Michael Howard. He’s a curator of jellies and collects at FHL annually. It was really cool to see how the exhibit was set up and how they rear jellies and ctenophores. The aquarium was so cool, especially the Into the Deep exhibit. I pet a giant isopod - very cool.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe did about 800k reads for the ONT run on Thursday, so we flushed the flow cell and ran the other half of our sample. We had about 40% of the cells left after the first run so we are hoping to make it to 1.5 M reads. We got that rolling and went over to CALeDNA to go through some community ecology code and troubleshoot our QC errors in the Tronko pipeline. Due to the problems with Tronko we had our code run throough Anacapa as a first pass. We said our goodbyes and will get together over Zoom to do work across our data when all of the QC stuff is completed through Tronko. We will also have to follow up with Dori and the initial processing of the ONT data since that is in queue to be qc’d after a few other running projects and that will take about a week or so.\n\n\n\n\nStarted the day in the Vollmers Lab where Dori walked us through the clean-up of the 529, the exonuclease clean-up and the completion of the library prep and flow cell preparation and load. We started sequencing on the minION this afternoon after a primer on how to prime and load the flow cell. We will return in the morning when Dori has data to look at to determine if the sequencing output is worthwhile. Worth note, she truncated the sample prep due to our time constraints in ways that she determined most useful. Since she is a field expert, we followed her lead. Also worth note, flow cell preparation is time consuming and key to successful sequencing. We decided to load 150 ng of DNA (~4uL of sample) which is about half of what remains after the cleaning and general size selection. When we opend MinKNOW and checked the flow cell 1257 pores were ready to sequence. From check to sequencing it took about 30 minutes to get a run going. She first started by removing the air from the flow cell by gently placing a p1000 pipette tip and light pressure to remove air. It is important to note that you do not ‘pull’ anything. A small amount of the fluid in the cell to keep it wet will enter the pipette tip. You will also know that flow cell is ready when you see the ‘holding’ fluid moves. Next you flush with 200uL of the primer and primer tether. This is slow and you must ensure not to introduce air. You also cannot ‘pull’ anything back into the flow cell - nothing flows in reverse. There is a waste cell that will catch and release things. After about 10 - 15 minutes you prime again with 800 uL of the priming solution and then prepare your file structure and set up for a run. Your sample gets mixed with Nanopore beads and that requires a few (only a few) pipette mixings before being loaded drop by drop into the flow cell. If your sample doesn’t load, add a bit more primer solution to clear the channel and try again. At this point the flow cell will get to temperature, preform another check and then run. The MinKNOW interface gives you some diagnostic information on the run during the process. It is worth note that this lab doesn’t do live basecalling because it is a resource suck and not helpful. They have established scripts that do the basecalling from their in lab setup. Dori will run the sequencer overnight and let us know in the morning if it is good. - Camille and I ended the day giving a BIMS/ Yellow Island Project seminar.\n\n\n\n\nVollmers Lab day with sample prep for ONT minION sequencing. Working with Dorie we are preparing our existing Illumina library for sequencing on the minION using a technique developed in this lab. They circularize the dna with splits so that the capacity of the minION can be used to our advantage. the minION is useful for really long reads, but our primers and sequences are short so the splints help us make it a loop that keeps getting sequenced.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeeting with Steven to go over updates from our last meeting. We discussed progress on the process here at UCSC, committee members, preparing for my first committee meeting, and Innovation Grant meeting.\nI went over to the UCSC campus to work on running a QC gel to identify the potential sources of contamination that are present in everything sequenced from the CALeDNA lab on Friday. We found that genomic DNA contaminated all of the samples after the pooling & indexing phase. Their lab biochemist worked on that while we toured the biomed/ paleogenomics labs on the UCSC main campus.\nWe ended with a graduate student in the Vollmers Lab, Dori Deng, who works on improving ONT process and protocol for sequencing with their tools. She sent us papers and protocols that they use to sequence on the minION and we will go back tomorrow to begin the library prep for minION sequencing on Thursday and Friday.\n\n\n\n\n\nToday we learn eDNA explorer and begin to work through the protocols for using the Nanopore MinION. It is important to note that we are using the eDNA processing protocol from the CALeDNA website: https://ucedna.com/methods-for-researchers/. We previewed the eDNA website and functionality, went over a quick review of what we were expecting and what we received. Camille and I cleaned up the metadata and some of the files in the folder so we could get data and metadata over to Levi - a member of the CALeDNA lab - to get everything uploaded to eDNA Explorer.\n\n\n\n\n\nSunday. Beach Day\n\n\n\n\n\nSaturday. Day Off to roam around Santa Cruz.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe made it with plenty of time to spare. We went in, bead cleaned, spec’d, and had to normalize 4 values that kept showing above the maximum. Next step was to take the concentrations from the specing, do some calculations using the CALeDNA template to determine the amount of each sample to add to the final pool. The goal was 100uL total with a concentration of 100nm, but our values were so variable that we did some manipulations so we could make volume limits. So, the end result is to combine all of our samples in one tube with no more than 100nm/100uL of sample and split it into 2 tubes with 50uL each - one to send and one for back up. Since our concentrations were so variable, we chose to drop 6 samples that were below .5 since we have replicates and combine at a higher volume and concentrate. We combined at 323uL withour water (which is an add is all the stars align and a snow lepard speaks to you) and concentrated the sample using a multifuge where we manipulated time and heat to concentrate the sample down to 100uL total. Once finished we split the sample in half - one to the sequencer and one as a backup where the team will extract about 5uL for specing again. We completed the sequencing form and the eDNA explorer metadata form for later seamless transition from completed sequencing to file and bioinformatic process management.\n\n\n\n\n\nStarted the morning by balancing the PCR plates to combat some samples that may have evaporated, pooling the 18S plates and then bead cleaning. After bead cleaning we spec’d our results and moved into the second to last pooling. We pooled based on calculations that took our concentrations reported from the Spectometer and made a pool of both markers at equal molarity to move into making our indices. Once we tediously pipetted ridiculous amounts of each plate (COI and 18S) into a new, we began to prepare for indexing. This included a standardized amount of DNA from our pooliing plate, a PCR master mix, our indices (Corbett Primers 4+8), and water. We completed calculations (total 25uL in each well), prepped the plate and sent it through it’s last PCR. At the conclusion we took it out, checked for evaporation and put it in the fridge. Tommorow we will do a final bead clean, spec and pool before sending over to the Illumina NextSeq by 2pm.\n\n\n\n\n\nLabwork and more labwork. Started by PCRing the missing column fron our first 18S plate, went up to bead clean and spec the COI plate and that was successful. The 18S plate not so much. We pooled samples, began the bead cleaning and then got lost in the process and threw away the DNA. So, we remade an aliquot plate for the samples, remade 3 plates for PCR and ended the day with all three in the thermocycler.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe started the day looking at the 2 plates from yesterday after their thermocycler run. Both were run using the touchdown protocol and temperature setting for their respective primer. The 18S used the thermocycler that they said was the best and there was no evaporation off of the plate. The COI plate did experience some evaporation and those wells were topped off with DNAFree Water so they were essentially ‘even’. We moved into making a gel and loading 10 samples from each plate including a blank. We imaged it and were happy with the result so we moved forward with completing the PCRs for the remaining two plates per primer set. We attended the Meyer Lab meeting where we shared a bit about ourselves and our project and everyone set intentions/ goals for the week.\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst day in the Meyer’s Lab. We did introductions, lab safety & tour, and mapped out a tentative plan for the next week. We since each extracted sample has varying amounts we added 20uL of DNAFree water to each and then aliquoted 16uL onto a plate. We prepped 2 PCR plates, one for 18S and another for COI, using 2uL of sample and 13uL of mix. We had enough time at the end of the day to put them both in the thermocycler and will run the gels tomorrow.\n\n\n\n\n\nSunday. Travel to UCSC\n\n\n\n\n\nSaturday. UW Photo Day with Chloe\n\n\n\n\n\nLast day at HFS, lots of close out duties. Gardell lab meeting. During the lab meeting we updated on our project progress and set our goals/ intentions for the remainder of the summer break. Mine were to make progress on the p450 work and to process the eDNA samples.\n\n\n\n\n\nDDCSP Summit Day! We wrapped summit with an bespoke poem from Carolyn Finney and a group dinner. Amazing day.\n\n\n\n\n\nI met with a prospective PhD applicant, Leah Ferger, about possibly joining the lab in 2024. For the remainder of the day I closed out Yellow Island project budgets and invoices and grabbed the FedEx supplies for shipping my samples down to UCSC.\n\n\n\n\n\nHad a meeting with Steven to get back on track with my work and degree progress. We agreed I’ll submit to present at SICB, the abstract is due 8/29/23, we went over committee and project updates. The ultimate goal is to get my current projects over the home stretch, get my committee formed, and clarify my work’s direction. After that, I spent some time in the lab on an emotional rollercoaster induced by the Nanodrop to take a quick look at the DNA quantities in my extractions. The quantity was varied but there is a discrepancy between the amount and the peaks at salt absorption…\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is the start of my final week at HFS. Today was a full day of turnover tasks in preparation for my departure.\n\n\n\n\n\nSeafair Sunday!\n\n\n\n\n\nSeafair Saturday!\n\n\n\n\n\nFinished DNA extractions for the Yellow Island eDNA project. All samples but one came out, so now we have 59 samples total for processing at UCSC.\n\n\n\n\n\nFinal check-outs and working with Logan and Coira to finalize their papers for submission by 8/4/23. Return to Seattle on the late ferry.\n\n\n\n\n\nCompleted all of the program exit interviews wiht the REUs and DDCSPs. Took them to dinner and ended the day with a gratitude circle.\nCleaned up all spaces and returned all equipment.\n\n\n\n\n\nREU presentations! My folks did an excellent job presenting their work - the entire cohort did an excellent job."

All plates had both standards and samples in triplicate with a ‘control’ of sample #1 on each plate to help determine consistency in the plate reader. This will force sample #1 to only be run in duplicate vice triplicate when we begin the p450 assay on 10/12/23 due to reduced volume."

    "text": "Attended Env lecture.\nAttended BIMS Institute meeting. This was our initial meeting where we discussed the purpose of the institue and where we were heading for the next year.\nWorked on the p450 and SOD data for the biomarker paper. There are some data anomalies that need to be thrown out, but I will review those with Alison next week.\nGraded OSS papers for ENV.\nAttended the first true BGG of the quarter where we set goals and intentions for the upcoming semester and year.\n\n\n\n\n\nUWT lab day. I reran all BCAs that were out of range from Saturday’s run. Worked with Ly to load and run all remaining SOD assays.\nI worked with Sam to confirm my SOD values were correct from my first plate.\nMet with Professor Jennifer Burnaford to discuss being a speaker at the MARINe Annual Conference. I will speak about integrating molecular techniques with existing intertidal methods to make the field more accessible to all.\n\n\n\n\n\nAttended ENV 100 lecture, teaching team meeting and led two quiz sections. Feedback from the students on how this course matches expectation was not what I expected. Most frustration comes with balancing workload, lack of feedback, and the assignments in this course. Others come from navigating Canvas and fully reading the instructions. I will take this information to the teaching team meeting next week.\n\n\n\n\n\nSunday. Morning writing accountability with Taylor. I did all of the calculations for the BCAs from the day before and rewrote some of the SOD protocol to include the nuance of things like the shaking table settings and reagent prep timing.\nWatched my Ravens lose in the AFC divisional round.\nEvening writing accountability with Taylor. I completed my quiz section preparation and poster groups set-up for Monday.\nGraded OSS papers for ENV.\n\n\n\n\n\nSaturday. UWT labday. I ran a SOD test plate and BCA dilution plate and did the math before completing the BCAs for all 312 samples.\n\n\n\n\n\nWriting accountability session 1 of 2 with Taylor this morning. I used this early time to catch up on emails and prep for my quiz section weekly round-up emails to set students up for the following week.\nAttended ENV lecture, led my final quiz section for the week and sent out the weekly ENV round-up to all three of my quiz sections in preparation with action items to prepare for the upcoming midterm.\nMet with ENV students for Office Hour.\nAttended weekly FAB Retros meeting where we setup schedules and research goals for next week.\nAttended Gardell Lab meeting where we shared our progress YTD and Winter Quarter goals. My goals center around data analysis and manuscript writing for the Biomarkers paper, Homo-aquaticus manuscript summary and eDNA presentation.\nHeld writing accountability 2 of 2 with Taylor. I worked on streamlining the SOD protocol after performing the assay on Thursday. I also completed the calculations on the assay ran yesterday. There are some plating errors and most of the final values are out of range. I will go into the lab tomorrow to run my BCAs to check protein concentration and then rerun the SOD to ensure there was no operator error to account for the extreme variability of the current result.\n\n\n\n\n\nUWT lab day. We completed all homogenizations for the SOD assay. We made the stock buffers and ran our first plate. Quick plotting looks like there are a few values that fall outside of the standard curve set by the assay standards. I will verify my calculations to determine if we need to dilute the samples, but for now it looks like we can run as outlined in the assay protocol from the manufacturer.\nI received my abstract confirmation for presentation from UN Ocean Decades. I will be presenting in Session 4, Community engaged science and mentorship, where I will present about my Yellow Island work. I’m definitely excited.\n\n\n\n\n\nAttended ENV lecture, made quiz section assignments for next week’s role play, and started grading the outside seminar papers.\nCompleted the Yellow Island Site application for the 2024 DDCSP cohort.\nAttended Black Grad Group\nAttended the Michael Twitty Townhall Lecture. It was engaging to hear him speak of his journey, the focus of his book The Cooking Gene, and his exploration of his lineage and identities through following the food and culture of Southern Black descendents of the enslaved.\nEvening Working Session with Taylor. I worked on incorporating the scholar’s feedback on the Yellow Island website, got the summer tide schedule predictions over to Melissa at DDCSP so we could work on housing, finished cleaning up the p450 data and began a bit of analysis.\nRead Chapter 5 in Race After Technology.\n\n\n\n\n\nUWT lab day. Ly and I finished all tissues dissections for the SOD assay and began the homogenizations to prepare for assaying. We were also able to start consolidating samples and putting a few things away that we won’t need to access regualarly.\n\n\n\n\n\nAttended ENV 100 lecture and teaching team meeting.\nLed two quiz sections through the Indigenous walking tour and content review guide in preparation for the midterm.\nAttended the FAB writing accountabilty session where I worked on cleaning up the full p450 dataset. I started putting all of the samples together by site and verfiying all BCA and p450 values were calculated correctly, sought out outliers to double check, and started grouping by site for analysis later this week.\nReviewed the SOD protocol from the manufacturer as well as the modified protocol we already had.\n\n\n\n\n\nSunday. Completed some grading and prepared for quiz section.\nWorked on the manuscript summary for the Homo-aquaticus special issue due to Frontiers at the end of the week. I created an annotated bibliography to keep track of resources and writing direction. Once this is complete I want to run it past Jose and then invite Corey to write with us.\n\n\n\n\n\nSaturday. Watched my Ravens take out the Texans!\n\n\n\n\n\nAccountability writing hour with Taylor and FAB weekly retros.\nAttended ENV 100 lecture and held office hour.\nOpened an issue for my inability to load packages on Raven despite always having access. Sam responded with some options to get the packages to load.\n\n\n\n\n\nAttended lab meeting and met with Steven later in the day to discuss the progess on a few projects I am working on.\nSpent time working on the literature review for a manuscript summary due next week.\n\n\n\n\n\nAttended ENV lecture and held office hours.\nHad my monthly mentorship meeting with Julia and met with Jose to discuss authoring an article together.\nStarted working on the p450 data. I completed the BCA protein calculations and the subsequent p450 values normalized by the protein concentrations. These values are aligned with the rest of the redo so I can move forward with analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\nUWT lab day. I finished the qc run for the BCA assay and the last samples for the p450 assay. All data is in hand for this assay, finally. Ly and I talked through next steps with the SOD assays. The tissue homogenization process is two steps and straight to assay, so the feasibility of completing SOD assays by the end of the month is highly likely.\n\n\n\n\n\nMonday. I spent today working on my Hall application. I am not going to move forward with the application. I want something a bit more aligned with my end goal. I have to tie my larger scale ecosystem work to my mechanistic interrogation and I believe a combination of metabolomics and microbiome work on mytilus can be that bridge.\nFAB writing accountability meeting.\n\n\n\n\n\nSunday. Worked on my bypass package, mainly my MS thesis.\nFinished grading for the week and sent the weekly round-up email to the quiz sections.\n\n\n\n\n\nSaturday. Off.\n\n\n\n\n\nAttended ENV lecture and led quiz section.\nHeld writing accountability with Taylor. I worked on p450 methods and some ideas for my Hall Conservation Proposal.\nFAB schedule retro and teaching evaluation review.\n\n\n\n\n\nUWT lab day. Ly finished pulling out tissue for the p450 redo and made it to the halfway mark on tissue dissection for SOD assay prep. I finished homogenate processing for the last 75 samples for the p450 QC run. Next step is to plate and run BCA and p450 to compare to the tests for BFC test and initial p450 results.\nAttended lab meeting but left after 30 minutes to attend to a tank failure in the Gardell lab that was leaking water across the floor.\nMet with WDFW folks to discuss authorship and results on the p450 paper. In addition to myself, Steven and Alison we will be adding Mariko, Danielle and Molly from WDFW.\nAttended the Salish Sea Institute webinar “Sharing Knowledge Across Disciplines & Borders” where I learned about the initiatives of the WWU- housed organization and some opportunities to work with them when doing Salish Sea work.\n\n\n\n\n\nAttended ENV 100 lecture and started grading.\nMet with Jose to discuss an upcoming mentor call and potential co-authorship on a paper about ocean science pedagogy.\nMet with Matt to work out basic logistics for the 2024 Yellow Island season.\nReviewed p450 work from the day prior. The plate shows the appropriate gradation in BFC across all three mediums (microsomal buffer, DI water, and sample). The blanks were a bit inconsistent, but the rest of the result lends itself as confirmation that the preliminary results we got in December were accurate. Ly and I will rerun the last batch of 75 samples with odd BCA values in the next few days.\n\n\n\n\n\nUWT lab day. I updated the tissue prep protocol for the p450 assays to mitigate some of the interference we saw in the first round of data acquisition. After that I ran a test assay to assess fluorescence levels with the BFC across a gradient, with and without sample, and with and without buffer and DI water.\n\n\n\n\n\nAttended ENV lecture, teaching team meeting, and led two of my three quiz sections.\nWatched my Huskies lose the CFP to Michigan.\n\n\n\n\n\nSunday. Prepared for upcoming week and quiz sections.\n\n\n\n\n\nSaturday. Attended SICB.\n\n\n\n\n\nWriting accountability with Taylor where I worked on Yellow Island program review.\nAttended ENV lecture.\nAttended SICB and made my first conference presentation. I presented on using eDNA for biodiversity assessment in complement with physical methods.\n\n\n\n\n\nAttended SICB in the morning.\nWorked on my SICB presentation in the afternoon and evening.\n\n\n\n\n\nWorked on my presentation storyline.\nAttended ENV 100 lecture.\nAttended SICB.

For the higher end samples, I diluted the samples by half.

For the higher end samples, I diluted the samples by half. Because most of the high samples were more than double the upper limit on their respective standard curves, I halved the concentration and then plated each with the full standard and the 50% reduction to ensure the samples that weren’t that high in protein content would also fall in one curve or the other.\nHeld office hours from 10am - 12pm for students to get support for their persuasive essay drafts.\nWas a preliminary audience member for Taylor’s practice run through of her dissertation."

I didn’t annotate everything I added and that is a mistake to keep in mind for future me. I need to at least make a quick 2-3 sentences about what I am trying to understand with that paper.\n\n\n\n05 March\n\nWriting I worked on my Nature opinion draft. I reread the message from the editor and made it more specific to eDNA and field work instead of the general sequencing work I was discussing. I also tried to cement why space is important, but I am not sure I got there.\nCoding I worked on the quantitative addition to my goals page. I think I have to put a pin in this one and come back it at the end of the month when I have more time.\nResearch/ Bench Work I started gathering the sources into a Zotero library for the biomarker paper.

I also added my general project idea to an open GH issue for experiment ideas for a shellfish field project.\nCoding I worked on cleaning up the exploratory data visualizations. I was able to get the PCA loaded correctly but not the correlation plot with only the variables I want.\nCoding I spent some time trying to add a quantitative portion to my monthly logs. I would like to count how many times one of ten tags was used throughout the month and create a pie chart or stacked bar by week to visualize how I’m spending my time.\n\n\n\n03 March\n\nSunday.
